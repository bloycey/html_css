# HTML/CSS

Week 1, Session 1 - Intro to Websites

## Learning Objectives

Students will:

-   Feel comfortable working in a code editor.
-   Comprehend what HTML and CSS are, and how they work together to create webpages.

## Notes

-   The goal here is to get everyone coding websites on day one. We want it to feel exciting and powerful, even though there's a lot to cover. Stress that they have plenty of time to practise this and don't need to memorise.
-   Try and get everyone to create a folder on their desktop to store repos of their work in for now. We will have them working in their home directory soon, but they haven't touched the command line yet, so it's too early for that today.
    -   Remember to stress each time you start a new codebase that they should create a new subdirectory for it.
-   At this stage, students haven't been exposed to Git or Github. This means that getting them access to example code is a little clunky. Best bet is to drop the files into slack one-by-one, as needed. They're only small, after all.
    -   Note that because they'll be downloading the files through slack, students will have to place the supplied files into a correct directory structure.
-   This is a huge lesson! Try to move through steadily without going on deep-dives, but don't stress if you can't get through everything. Just make a note of where you're up to, and finish it off next session.

## Homework

Probably you weren't able to get through everything. That's ok - tell them to have a fool around with CSS selectors/properties in their own time. Finish the content off next session.
